Wandering in the Woods – Design Document


1. Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
The Wandering in the Woods simulation shall allow students to configure a grid-based environment,
place multiple players, and observe randomized movement until players meet. The system shall record
and display statistical data for each run.


Functional Requirements
1 • Allow grid size selection (rows and columns).
2 • Allow 2–4 players to be placed manually.
3 • Simulate random movement of players.
4 • Detect when players meet.
5 • Display run statistics (min, max, average).


Non-Functional Requirements
1 • The interface shall be simple and child-friendly.
2 • The system shall be robust to random input.
3 • The program shall run without requiring compilation.
2. Software Design
The system is modular and object-oriented. Each major responsibility is encapsulated in a separate
class.


Main Components
1 • main.py: Controls program flow and rendering.
2 • Grid: Manages grid layout and drawing.
3 • Player: Represents a player and its position.
4 • Simulation: Controls player movement and meeting logic.
5 • Stats: Collects and summarizes run statistics
